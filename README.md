# ShipDetect
This is one of my personal projects where I trained a CNN to detect ships based on croped images. The full scene(image) was photographyed by Planet satellites.

# Dataset
You can find the dataset that was use for training the model on Kaggle under the name 'Ships in Satellite Imagery'.
